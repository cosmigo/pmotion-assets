# Disclaimer

I assume in good faith that all of these bitmap fonts are freeware and redistributable. Most of them have been openly and freely circulating on the WWW and the demoscene for so many years that tracking their original authors isn't always possible.

Most of the fonts found are known to have been part of [Daniel Guldkrans' online fonts collection], which (to the best of my knowledge) openly allowed its visitors to download the fonts.

If you are the author of some of the fonts found here, and you object to their presence in this project, please [open an issue] and I'll take immediate action.

Likewise, if you are aware of some additional information about the fonts' authors, and/or copyright status, please [open an issue] and share that information so that due credits may be given to the fonts authors, and their license terms be honored.

## Daniel Guldkrans' Collection

The Daniel Guldkrans' bitmap fonts collection was hosted at [www.algonet.se/~guld1/freefont.htm]. The website is no longer active and it [wasn't archived by the Wayback Machine] due to `robots.txt` settings.

I haven't had a chance to visit Guldkrans' original website, and I've managed to get hold of his fonts only through third parties.

Both the `freefont.htm` part in the original URL, and the fact that most fonts images have a watermark saying "FONT BROUGHT TO YOU BY DANIEL GULDKRANS", suggest that they were intended for free distribution and circulation.

Many of the fonts in this collection carry a watermark stating "DRAWN BY DANIEL GULDKRANS". I assume those who don't bare this statement as being from some unknown author.
