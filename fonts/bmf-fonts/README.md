# ByteMap Fonts (BMF)

ByteMap Fonts (`*.bmf`) is an advanced bitmap file format, allowing for extra information and features like character position aligments.


# Resources List

-   [`/bmf-cz/`][bmf-cz] â€” 1132 BMF fonts collection from [bmf.php5.cz](http://bmf.php5.cz/) (courtesy of CRS).

> **NOTE**: The `/bmf-cz/` folder was temporarily named so because of the connection to the [bmf.php5.cz] website were the fonts can be found at. Folders names are just a means to maintain separation of contents (eg: actual fonts from fonts documentation or tools, etc.), and they will be subject to renaming as fonts get sorted into better categories (by authors, type, size, etc.).

# Disclaimer

I assume in good faith that all of these BMF fonts are freeware and redistributable. As the creator and maintainer of this repository, I [Tristano Ajmone] take full responsibility for their distribution.

# Aknowledgments

I want to thank CRS from [bmf.php5.cz] for kindly sharing the BMF fonts found in the [`/bmf-cz/`][bmf-cz] folder, and for his work of formats conversion.
