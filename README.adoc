// <<< GitHub/GitLab hacks <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<



== Introduction

// tag::intro[]
The goal of this project is to provide a collection of useful assets for Cosmigo Pro Motion NG, ranging from documentation, technical specifications of images, animations, palettes and pixeal art fonts format, to plugins code templates and intefaces in various programming languages, and community contributed assets like color formulas, palettes, etc.

Hopefully, these resources will be useful to both Pro Motion NG users as well as to other PM NG related projects, and version control via Git should provide an efficient way of keeping the assets always up to date, both locally as well as inside other repositories.

I would like to thank {Jan_Zimmerman} for all the personal support and time dedication, and for having kindly allowed me to utilize the original Pro Motion assets found in this project.

== Project Contents

* {docs} -- HTML documents.
* {docs_src} -- AsciiDoc sources and assets to build the HTML docs.
* {plugins} -- resources for plugin developers.
* {specs} -- technical stuff about standards and specs.
* {CONTRIBUTING} -- guidelines for submitting contents and collaborating.
* {LICENSE} -- Apache 2.0 license.

== HTML Live Previews

Here are some quick links to the HTML version of the documents via GitHub Pages:


=== Plugins


* link:{GHPages}Developer_Interface.html[Developer Interface]
* link:{GHPages}DDE-Plugin.html[Pro Motion DDE Plugin Interface]
* link:{GHPages}DDE_C.html[Pro Motion DDE Interface in C]
* link:{GHPages}File-IO_Agnostic-Interface.html[Pro Motion File I/O Plugin Interface] (language agnostic)


=== File Formats

* link:{GHPages}PMNG_File_Formats.html[Pro Motion NG File Formats]
* link:{GHPages}EA-IFF-85.html["`EA IFF 85`" Standard for Interchange Format Files]


== The HTML Docs Folder

* {docs}

The {docs} folder contains an HTML converted version of every `&ast;.asciidoc` file found inside the repository.
This folder was created for the following purposes:

* Enable end users to read local copies of the documents without needing an AsciiDoc viewer/converter.
* The contents of that folder can be served over the WWW via
  link:https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages^, title="Visit GitHub Pages website"].
* Direct links to these docs won't break if their AsciiDoc sources are moved around in the project.

All HTML documents are placed directly in the {docs} folder, without replicating the directory structure of their AsciiDoc sources within the project.
Therefore, even if the repository folder structure is reorganized, links to the HTML docs will remain unchanged (unless the AsciiDoc source files are renamed).

The whole idea is that `&ast;.asciidoc` files should be placed in the folder to which they belong contents-wise, so that they can be read on GitHub while navigating the repository.
GitHub provides live HTML rendering of AsciiDoc, so these documents will be previewable in a nicely formatted manner on GitHub.

The HTML converted docs, on the other hand, are intended for providing direct links which won't (shouldn't) break over the course of time, as well as for offline reading via the browser for end users who cloned the repository locally but might not have the required tools to view/convert AsciiDoc files.

Regarding the possibility of serving the HTML files over the Internet (statically) via
link:https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages^, title="Visit GitHub Pages website"]
it can be done
link:https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#publishing-your-github-pages-site-from-a-docs-folder-on-your-master-branch[using the `/docs/` folder in the `master` branch^, title="Read GitHub Help on how to do this"]
of every repository (instead of serving the whole `master` branch over the Internet, or using a separate `gh-pages` branch).
Hence, the {docs} folder was chosen since it's treated as a special folder in GitHub when it comes to serving web contents.
Although this is entirely optional, I've chosen to leave this possibility open, so that any GitHub clone of the repository can be set to serve these docs over the WWW.
